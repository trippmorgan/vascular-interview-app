---

### DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING

#### Ultrasound (Screening & Surveillance)
- [ ] Transabdominal ultrasound
- [ ] Measures maximum aortic diameter
- [ ] Cannot assess extent or anatomy for surgical planning
- [ ] Used for surveillance of small AAA

#### CT Angiography (CTA) - Gold Standard for Surgical Planning
- [ ] **Ordered when size approaches 5.5 cm or if planning surgery**
- [ ] Provides detailed anatomy:
  - Exact measurements (outer to outer diameter)
  - Proximal neck anatomy
  - Iliac anatomy and access vessels
  - Visceral arteries (renal, celiac, SMA)
  - Presence of thrombus
- [ ] 3D reconstruction helps surgical planning
- [ ] Determine EVAR vs open repair eligibility

#### Other Imaging
- [ ] MR angiography (if contrast allergy or renal insufficiency)
- [ ] Incidental finding on other imaging (chest X-ray, abdominal CT)

---

### SURVEILLANCE PLAN (FOR ANEURYSMS <5.5 CM)

#### Surveillance Intervals
- [ ] **3.0-3.9 cm**: Ultrasound every 3 years
- [ ] **4.0-4.9 cm**: Ultrasound every 12 months
- [ ] **5.0-5.4 cm**: Ultrasound every 6 months (consider CTA for surgical planning)
- [ ] Adjust based on growth rate and patient factors

#### Surveillance Imaging Modality
- [ ] Ultrasound (standard for small AAA)
- [ ] CT scan (if anatomy complex or nearing surgical size)

---

### TREATMENT DISCUSSION

#### Medical Management (ALL Patients)

**Risk Factor Modification**
- [ ] **Smoking cessation** (CRITICAL):
  - Slows aneurysm growth
  - Reduces rupture risk
  - Improves surgical outcomes
  - Refer to cessation program
- [ ] **Blood pressure control**:
  - Target <140/80 mmHg
  - Beta-blockers sometimes used (controversial)
- [ ] **Lipid management**:
  - Statin therapy
  - LDL <100 mg/dL
- [ ] **Antiplatelet therapy**:
  - Aspirin (for concurrent atherosclerotic disease)

**Surveillance**
- [ ] Serial imaging per schedule
- [ ] Annual or biannual follow-up appointments
- [ ] Report any new symptoms immediately (pain, pulsation)

---

#### Surgical/Procedural Options

**EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) - Minimally Invasive**
- [ ] **Procedure description**:
  - "Small incisions in both groins"
  - "Thread a stent-graft up through the arteries"
  - "Stent-graft lines the inside of the aneurysm"
  - "Excludes aneurysm sac from blood flow"
- [ ] **Advantages**:
  - Faster recovery (1-2 day hospital stay)
  - Lower perioperative mortality
  - Less invasive (no large abdominal incision)
  - Better for high-risk patients
- [ ] **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires lifelong surveillance imaging (CT scans)
  - Risk of endoleak (blood flow into aneurysm sac)
  - May need reintervention (10-20% over time)
  - Not suitable for all anatomies
- [ ] **Eligibility**:
  - Adequate aortic neck (length, diameter, angulation)
  - Suitable iliac access vessels
  - CTA determines eligibility

**Open Surgical Repair**
- [ ] **Procedure description**:
  - "Large incision down the middle of your belly"
  - "Clamp the aorta, open the aneurysm"
  - "Sew in a synthetic graft (Dacron tube)"
  - "Graft replaces weakened segment"
- [ ] **Advantages**:
  - Durable, long-term solution
  - Low reintervention rate
  - No surveillance CT scans required
  - Suitable for all anatomies (including complex)
- [ ] **Disadvantages**:
  - Major surgery (4-7 day hospital stay)
  - Longer recovery (6-8 weeks)
  - Higher perioperative mortality (~3-5%)
  - Not suitable for very high-risk patients
- [ ] **When preferred**:
  - Young, healthy patients (better long-term)
  - Hostile neck anatomy (not EVAR candidate)
  - Ruptured AAA (some centers)

### SURGICAL CANDIDACY ASSESSMENT

#### Factors Favoring Surgery (≥5.5 cm or symptomatic)
- [ ] Size ≥5.5 cm (high rupture risk)
- [ ] Rapid growth (>0.5 cm/year)
- [ ] Symptomatic (pain, tenderness)
- [ ] Family history of rupture
- [ ] Female gender (higher rupture risk at smaller sizes)

#### Factors Affecting Surgical Risk
- [ ] **Cardiac risk**:
  - Prior heart attack, stents, bypass
  - Heart failure
  - Stress test or cardiac catheterization results
- [ ] **Pulmonary risk**:
  - COPD, emphysema
  - Smoking history
  - Pulmonary function tests
- [ ] **Renal function**:
  - Creatinine level
  - Dialysis (very high risk)
- [ ] **Age and frailty**:
  - Physiologic age more important than chronologic
  - Activity level and functional status
- [ ] **Life expectancy**:
  - If limited (<2-3 years), may opt for surveillance

---

### RUPTURE RISK DISCUSSION
- [ ] **"Aorta ≥5.5 cm needs repair"** (key teaching point)
- [ ] Risk of rupture increases exponentially with size:
  - <4 cm: <1% per year
  - 4-5 cm: 1-2% per year
  - 5-5.5 cm: 3-5% per year
  - >5.5 cm: 10-20% per year
- [ ] **Rupture is catastrophic**:
  - 80-90% mortality overall
  - 50% die before reaching hospital
  - Emergency surgery has 50% mortality
- [ ] **Elective repair mortality**:
  - EVAR: <1-2%
  - Open repair: 3-5%
  - Much safer than waiting for rupture

---

### SHARED DECISION-MAKING
- [ ] Risks and benefits of surgery discussed
- [ ] Alternative: Continued surveillance
- [ ] Patient's goals and preferences
- [ ] Quality of life considerations
- [ ] Family involvement in decision

---

### FOLLOW-UP PLAN

#### For Surveillance Patients (<5.5 cm)
- Next ultrasound (date, interval)
- Follow-up appointment (when)
- Instructions: Report any new pain or symptoms immediately

#### For Surgical Patients
- CTA scheduled (if not yet done)
- Pre-operative testing:
  - Cardiac clearance (stress test, echo, catheterization)
  - Pulmonary function tests (if COPD)
  - Lab work (CBC, CMP, coagulation)
- Surgery scheduled (date, location)
- Pre-op appointment with surgeon
- Anesthesia consultation (if needed)

---

## AAA CATEGORIZATION
- [ ] **Small AAA**: 3.0-4.4 cm (surveillance)
- [ ] **Medium AAA**: 4.5-5.4 cm (close surveillance, consider patient factors)
- [ ] **Large AAA**: ≥5.5 cm (surgical repair indicated)
- [ ] **Symptomatic AAA**: Any size with symptoms (urgent repair)
- [ ] **Ruptured AAA**: Emergency (immediate surgery)

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Extract aneurysm size EXACTLY as stated (this is the most critical data point)
- Document growth rate if serial measurements mentioned
- Note whether patient is symptomatic (changes urgency)
- Capture discussion of EVAR vs open repair (patient education important)
- Document risk factors (especially smoking and family history)
- Flag urgent situations (symptomatic or ruptured AAA)
- Note patient's understanding of rupture risk and need for surveillance or surgery
