## CAROTID DISEASE-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT

### SYMPTOMATIC VS ASYMPTOMATIC (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)

#### Stroke History
- [ ] Has patient ever had a stroke?
- [ ] If yes:
  - When did stroke occur? (exact date/year)
  - Which side was affected? (left or right)
  - What symptoms occurred? (weakness, speech, vision)
  - Residual deficits? (current weakness, speech issues)
  - Full recovery or persistent symptoms?
  - Treatment received (tPA, thrombectomy, rehabilitation)

#### TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack / Mini-Stroke)
- [ ] Has patient ever had a TIA?
- [ ] If yes:
  - When did TIA occur?
  - Symptoms (resolved within 24 hours)
  - How long did symptoms last?
  - Multiple TIAs or single episode?

#### Recency (Key for Surgical Decision)
- **If stroke/TIA >2 years ago**: Consider asymptomatic for surgical purposes
- **If stroke/TIA within 2 years**: Symptomatic (changes surgical indication)

- [ ] Which side?

#### Cognitive/Other Symptoms
- [ ] Confusion or altered mental status?
- [ ] Memory issues?
- [ ] Dizziness or vertigo?
- [ ] Headaches?

---

### DISTINGUISH FROM OTHER CONDITIONS
- [ ] Vision issues due to cataracts or macular degeneration?
- [ ] Dizziness due to inner ear problems or vertigo?
- [ ] Weakness due to orthopedic issues or neuropathy?

---

### CAROTID STENOSIS GRADING

#### Stenosis Percentage (If Known)
- Right carotid artery: ___% stenosis
- Left carotid artery: ___% stenosis

#### Clinical Significance Explained to Patient
- [ ] **<50% stenosis**: Medical management only, no surgery
- [ ] **50-80% stenosis**: Surgery considered if symptomatic
- [ ] **≥80% stenosis**: Surgery recommended (unless high risk)

#### Velocity Criteria from Ultrasound
- **Right carotid:**
  - PSV (Peak Systolic Velocity): _____ cm/s
  - EDV (End Diastolic Velocity): _____ cm/s
- **Left carotid:**
  - PSV: _____ cm/s
  - EDV: _____ cm/s

**Interpretation:**
- PSV ≥125 cm/s = >50% stenosis
- EDV ≥125 cm/s = >80% stenosis

---

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS

#### Neurologic Exam
- [ ] Alert and oriented x3 (person, place, time)?
- [ ] Speech normal vs aphasia/dysarthria?
- [ ] Cranial nerves intact?
- [ ] Motor strength (5/5 in all extremities or deficits noted)
- [ ] Sensory exam normal?
- [ ] Coordination and gait normal?
- [ ] Any residual deficits from prior stroke?

#### Vascular Exam
- [ ] Carotid bruits present?
  - Right carotid bruit: Yes / No
  - Left carotid bruit: Yes / No
- [ ] Cardiac exam (murmurs, irregular rhythm)
- [ ] Peripheral pulses (rule out generalized atherosclerosis)

---

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

#### Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
- Date of study
- Results (stenosis percentage, velocities)
- Bilateral disease or unilateral?
- Plaque characteristics (if mentioned)

#### CT Angiography (CTA) of Neck
- [ ] Ordered for surgical planning (typically if ≥80% stenosis)
- [ ] Results pending or completed?
- [ ] Confirms degree of stenosis
- [ ] Assesses plaque morphology and vessel anatomy

#### Brain Imaging (CT or MRI)
- [ ] Any prior strokes visible on imaging?
- [ ] Location and extent of infarcts
- [ ] Chronic vs acute changes

---

### TREATMENT PLAN DISCUSSION

#### Medical Management (ALL Patients)
- [ ] **Antiplatelet therapy**:
  - Aspirin 81 mg daily, or
  - Plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily
- [ ] **High-dose statin therapy**:
  - Target LDL <70 mg/dL
  - Medication and dose discussed
- [ ] **Blood pressure control**:
  - Target <140/80 mmHg
  - Coordinate with primary care
- [ ] **Diabetes control** (if diabetic):
  - Target A1C <6.5-7.0%
- [ ] **Smoking cessation** (if applicable)

#### Surgical Options Discussed

**Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA)**
- [ ] Open surgical procedure
- [ ] "We make an incision in your neck"
- [ ] "Clean out the plaque from inside the artery"
- [ ] General anesthesia vs regional block
- [ ] Hospital stay (typically 1-2 nights)
- [ ] Risks: Stroke, heart attack, bleeding, nerve injury
- [ ] Benefits: Stroke prevention (especially if symptomatic or ≥80%)

**Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)**
- [ ] Minimally invasive procedure
- [ ] Catheter inserted through groin
- [ ] Balloon and stent placed in carotid artery
- [ ] Used in select patients (high surgical risk, prior neck surgery/radiation)
- [ ] Typically outpatient or 1-night stay

#### Surveillance (If Not Surgical Candidate)
- [ ] Repeat carotid duplex in 6-12 months
- [ ] Watch for symptom development
- [ ] Continue medical management

---

### SURGICAL CANDIDACY ASSESSMENT
- [ ] **Recommend surgery**: Symptomatic with ≥50% or asymptomatic with ≥80%
- [ ] **Medical management only**: <50% stenosis or high surgical risk
- [ ] **Shared decision-making**: 50-80% asymptomatic (discuss risks/benefits)

#### Factors Affecting Surgical Decision
- Degree of stenosis
- Symptomatic vs asymptomatic
- Patient age and life expectancy
- Comorbidities (cardiac disease, diabetes, kidney function)
- Patient preference

---

### URGENCY ASSESSMENT
- [ ] **Urgent** ("Come get me and we'll get a CTA"): Symptomatic with ≥80% stenosis
- [ ] **Semi-urgent**: Recent TIA or crescendo TIAs
- [ ] **Elective**: Asymptomatic high-grade stenosis, stable symptoms

---

### FOLLOW-UP PLAN
- CTA scheduled (date)
- Surgery scheduled (date, location)
- Follow-up appointment (when)
- Instructions: Watch for new neurologic symptoms (call immediately if stroke symptoms)
- Coordinate with primary care for risk factor management

---

## LATERALITY & SEVERITY
- [ ] **Right carotid stenosis**: ____%
- [ ] **Left carotid stenosis**: ____%
- [ ] **Bilateral disease**
- [ ] **Symptomatic** (stroke/TIA related to stenosis)
- [ ] **Asymptomatic** (incidental finding or old event)

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Carefully distinguish symptomatic vs asymptomatic (critical for surgical indication)
- Document exact timeline of neurologic events (recency matters)
- Note which side had symptoms and which side has stenosis (should correlate)
- Extract stenosis percentages and velocities exactly as stated
- Flag urgent situations (symptomatic ≥80% stenosis)
- Document patient's understanding of stroke risk and treatment options
