## DIALYSIS ACCESS-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT

### DIALYSIS HISTORY

#### Kidney Disease Background
- [ ] End-stage renal disease (ESRD) diagnosis
- [ ] Cause of kidney failure:
  - Diabetes
  - Hypertension
  - Polycystic kidney disease
  - Glomerulonephritis
  - Other/Unknown
- [ ] CKD stage (if not yet on dialysis)
- [ ] Kidney function (creatinine, GFR if mentioned)

#### Current Dialysis Status
- [ ] **Is patient currently on dialysis?**
- [ ] If yes:
  - How long on dialysis? (months, years)
  - Dialysis schedule (3x/week is standard - which days?)
  - Dialysis center location
- [ ] If not yet on dialysis:
  - Expected start date

---

### CURRENT ACCESS FUNCTION

#### Dialysis Performance
- [ ] **"Is your access working well?"**
- [ ] **"Does it dialyze well?"**
- [ ] Achieving adequate dialysis clearance (Kt/V if mentioned)
- [ ] "Do they have trouble sticking you?" (cannulation difficulties)
- [ ] "Have they told you the flows are low?"
  - Normal flow rates: >600 mL/min for fistula, >500 mL/min for graft
- [ ] Multiple stick attempts needed?
- [ ] Prolonged bleeding after needle removal?

#### Access Complications
- [ ] **Stenosis** (narrowing):
  - Elevated venous pressures during dialysis
  - Decreased flow rates
  - Location of stenosis (inflow, outflow, anastomosis)
- [ ] **Thrombosis** (clot in access):
  - Access stopped working suddenly
  - No thrill or bruit
  - When did it clot?
- [ ] **Infection**:
  - Redness around access site
  - Warmth, swelling, pain
  - Drainage or pus
  - Fever
  - Bacteremia (positive blood cultures)
- [ ] **Steal syndrome**:
  - Hand coldness
  - Pain in hand during dialysis
  - Numbness or weakness
  - Tissue loss in fingers
- [ ] **Aneurysm** (bulging/dilation):
  - Visible enlargement
  - Skin thinning
  - Risk of rupture

---

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS

#### Inspection

#### Palpation
- [ ] **Thrill** (palpable vibration):
  - Strong, weak, or absent
  - Continuous throughout length of access
  - Changes in character along access
- [ ] Pulse quality in hand distal to access
- [ ] Temperature of hand (warm vs cool - assess for steal)
- [ ] Edema in arm

#### Auscultation
- [ ] **Bruit** (audible whooshing sound):
  - Strong, weak, or absent
  - High-pitched (suggests stenosis)
  - Continuous vs pulsatile
- [ ] Listen at multiple points along access

#### Hand Examination (Assess for Steal Syndrome)
- [ ] Capillary refill (<2 seconds normal)
- [ ] Color (pink vs pale vs cyanotic)
- [ ] Temperature
- [ ] Strength (grip, finger movement)

---

### VEIN MAPPING / PRE-OP ASSESSMENT

#### Vein Mapping Results (If Done)
- [ ] Adequate veins identified for new fistula?
- [ ] Cephalic vein diameter and quality
- [ ] Basilic vein diameter and quality
- [ ] Perforating veins
- [ ] Central veins patent (no stenosis/occlusion)
- [ ] Arterial inflow adequate

#### Central Vein Status (CRITICAL)
- [ ] History of central venous catheters (IJ, subclavian)
- [ ] Central vein stenosis or occlusion?
  - Can compromise access function
  - Causes arm swelling
- [ ] Pacemaker or defibrillator wires (can cause central stenosis)

#### Previous Neck Catheters
- [ ] Which side(s) - right, left, or both
- [ ] Number of previous catheters
- [ ] Complications (infection, thrombosis)

---

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

#### Access Ultrasound / Fistulogram
- [ ] Ordered or completed?
- [ ] Findings:
  - Stenosis identified (location, severity %)
  - Thrombus present
  - Flow rates measured
- [ ] Plan: Angioplasty vs surgical revision

#### Other Studies
- [ ] Venogram (central vein assessment)
- [ ] Arterial duplex (assess inflow)
- [ ] Chest X-ray (if catheter placement)

---

### TREATMENT PLAN DISCUSSION

#### For Existing Access Dysfunction

**Endovascular Intervention (Angioplasty)**
- [ ] Balloon dilation of stenosis
- [ ] Usually outpatient procedure
- [ ] Can dialyze same day or next day
- [ ] May need repeat interventions over time

**Surgical Revision**
- [ ] Patch angioplasty
- [ ] Interposition graft
- [ ] Jump graft
- [ ] Revision of anastomosis

**Thrombectomy**
- [ ] Surgical or catheter-based clot removal
- [ ] Typically urgent/semi-urgent
- [ ] Address underlying stenosis to prevent recurrence

**Access Ligation**
- [ ] Tie off non-functional access
- [ ] If steal syndrome or infection not resolving
- [ ] Plan for new access elsewhere

---

#### For New Access Creation

**Fistula Creation (Preferred)**
- [ ] **Type discussed**:
  - Radiocephalic (wrist) - first choice if veins adequate
  - Brachiocephalic (elbow)
  - Brachiobasilic (upper arm with transposition)
- [ ] **Location**: Right arm vs left arm
  - Dominant vs non-dominant hand considerations
  - Preserve non-dominant for future access
- [ ] **Maturation time**: 6-12 weeks before use
  - "Fistula needs time to mature, get bigger and stronger"
  - Cannot dialyze through it immediately
- [ ] **Advantages**: Longer lifespan, lower infection risk
- [ ] **Exercises to help maturation**: Squeeze ball, hand exercises

**Graft Placement (If Veins Inadequate)**
- [ ] Synthetic tube connects artery to vein
- [ ] **Maturation time**: 2-4 weeks (faster than fistula)
- [ ] **Locations**: Forearm loop, upper arm straight or curved
- [ ] Higher risk of infection and thrombosis than fistula
- [ ] May need more interventions over time

**Catheter Placement (Bridge)**
- [ ] Temporary access while fistula/graft matures
- [ ] Tunneled catheter (Permcath, Hickman)
- [ ] Internal jugular vein (neck) - preferred
- [ ] Subclavian vein (chest) - avoid if possible (central stenosis risk)
- [ ] Femoral vein (groin) - temporary only
- [ ] Can dialyze immediately after placement
- [ ] Infection risk, affects quality of life
- [ ] Goal is to transition to fistula/graft as soon as possible

### PERIOPERATIVE PLAN

#### Surgery Details
- [ ] Procedure type and location (arm, side)
- [ ] Anesthesia: Local vs regional block vs general
- [ ] Outpatient vs overnight stay
- [ ] Surgery date and location

#### Post-Operative Instructions
- [ ] No blood pressure cuffs or IVs on access arm
- [ ] No tight sleeves or watches
- [ ] Keep surgical site clean and dry
- [ ] Check for thrill daily (teach patient)
- [ ] Watch for signs of infection
- [ ] When to start using access (maturation period)

#### Arm Care Education
- [ ] Protect access arm lifelong
- [ ] No needle sticks or blood draws from access arm
- [ ] Avoid trauma or heavy lifting with access arm
- [ ] Medical alert bracelet or notification

---

### ACCESS SURVEILLANCE

#### Monitoring Plan
- [ ] Monthly flow studies at dialysis center
- [ ] Access ultrasound if concerns
- [ ] Follow-up with vascular surgery (frequency)

  - If thrill disappears → call immediately

#### Warning Signs to Report
- [ ] Loss of thrill or bruit
- [ ] Increased difficulty with cannulation
- [ ] Prolonged bleeding
- [ ] Arm swelling
- [ ] Hand coldness or pain
- [ ] Redness, warmth, drainage (infection)
- [ ] Fever

- [ ] Peripheral arterial disease (poor inflow)
- [ ] Obesity (deeper vessels, difficult cannulation)
- [ ] Hypotension (low flow)
- [ ] Heart failure (low cardiac output)
- [ ] Advanced age

#### Long-Term Access Planning
- [ ] "Save the real estate" - preserve vessels
- [ ] Start distally (wrist) and move proximally (elbow, upper arm)
- [ ] Non-dominant arm first when possible
- [ ] Consider future access needs

---

### FOLLOW-UP PLAN
- Surgery scheduled (date, location)
- Pre-op testing needed
- Post-op follow-up appointment (when)
- When to start using access (maturation period)
- Dialysis center notified of plan
- Nephrology coordination

---

## ACCESS CATEGORIZATION
- [ ] **Primary access**: First access, no prior attempts
- [ ] **Secondary access**: After previous access failure
- [ ] **Tertiary or beyond**: Multiple previous failed access, limited options
- [ ] **Salvage access**: Difficult case, unusual location, complex anatomy

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Document current access type, location, and arm clearly
- Note whether access is functioning or dysfunctional (critical distinction)
- Extract flow rates, pressures, or other quantitative measures exactly
- Document previous access history (locations, outcomes)
- Capture patient education about access care and monitoring
- Note maturation timeline for new access (important for dialysis planning)
- Flag urgent issues (thrombosed access, severe steal syndrome, infection)
