## VTE-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT

### HISTORY OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (VTE)

#### Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) History
- [ ] **Has patient ever had a blood clot in the legs/arms?**
- [ ] If yes:
  - When did DVT occur? (exact date/year)
  - Which leg/arm? (right, left, bilateral)
  - Location (calf, thigh, iliac, upper extremity)
  - How was it diagnosed? (ultrasound, venogram)

#### Pulmonary Embolism (PE) History
- [ ] **Has patient ever had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)?**
- [ ] If yes:
  - When did PE occur? (exact date/year)
  - Symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis)
  - Severity (large, submassive, massive)
  - Required hospitalization? ICU admission?
  - How was it diagnosed? (CT angiography, V/Q scan)

#### Number of VTE Events
- [ ] First event (single episode)
- [ ] Recurrent VTE (multiple episodes)
- [ ] If recurrent: How many episodes? When did each occur?

---

### VTE CHARACTERIZATION (CRITICAL)

#### Provoked vs Unprovoked (VERY IMPORTANT)
This determines duration of anticoagulation.

**Provoked VTE** (identifiable temporary risk factor):
- [ ] Surgery (especially orthopedic, abdominal, pelvic)
  - Type of surgery
  - How long before/after surgery did VTE occur?
- [ ] Trauma or immobilization
  - Fracture, cast, bed rest
  - Duration of immobilization
- [ ] Pregnancy or postpartum (within 6 weeks)
- [ ] Hospitalization or acute illness
- [ ] Long travel (plane, car >4-6 hours)
- [ ] Central venous catheter (line-associated DVT)
- [ ] Oral contraceptives or hormone therapy

**Unprovoked VTE** (no clear temporary trigger):
- [ ] Spontaneous, no identifiable cause
- [ ] Higher risk of recurrence
- [ ] May need indefinite anticoagulation
- [ ] Consider thrombophilia workup

#### Risk Factors for VTE
- [ ] Cancer (active malignancy - high risk)
- [ ] Obesity (BMI >30)
- [ ] Smoking
- [ ] Varicose veins or venous insufficiency
- [ ] Age >60
- [ ] Prolonged immobility or bed rest
- [ ] Prior VTE (strongest predictor of recurrence)

---

### CURRENT ANTICOAGULATION STATUS

#### Currently on Blood Thinners?
- [ ] **Yes** - currently anticoagulated
- [ ] **No** - completed treatment course
- [ ] **No** - never anticoagulated (for other reasons patient seen)

#### Type of Anticoagulant
- [ ] **Warfarin (Coumadin)**:
  - Dose (mg per day, may vary by day of week)
  - INR target range (usually 2-3 for VTE)
  - Most recent INR value and date
  - Frequency of INR monitoring
- [ ] **Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)**:
  - Apixaban (Eliquis): Dose (2.5 mg or 5 mg BID)
  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto): Dose (15 mg or 20 mg daily)
  - Edoxaban (Savaysa): Dose (60 mg daily)
  - Dabigatran (Pradaxa): Dose (150 mg BID)
- [ ] **Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)**:
  - Enoxaparin (Lovenox): Dose and frequency
  - Used during pregnancy or bridge therapy
- [ ] **Unfractionated Heparin** (IV or subcutaneous):
  - Inpatient or home-based
  - aPTT monitoring

#### Duration of Anticoagulation
- [ ] How long has patient been on blood thinners?
- [ ] Planned duration of treatment:
  - **Provoked VTE**: Typically 3-6 months
  - **Unprovoked VTE**: Minimum 3-6 months, often indefinite
  - **Recurrent VTE**: Usually indefinite
  - **Cancer-associated VTE**: Duration of active cancer treatment
- [ ] "When are you supposed to stop the blood thinner?" (if finite course)
- [ ] Has prescribing physician discussed duration?

### COMPLICATIONS OF ANTICOAGULATION

#### Bleeding Events
- [ ] **Major bleeding** (requires hospitalization or transfusion):
  - Gastrointestinal bleeding (black stools, vomiting blood)
  - Intracranial hemorrhage (brain bleed)
  - Hematuria (blood in urine)
  - Severe nosebleeds
  - Other site (specify)
  - Date of bleeding event
- [ ] **Minor bleeding**:
  - Easy bruising
  - Prolonged bleeding from cuts
  - Gum bleeding
  - Heavy menstrual bleeding (women)
- [ ] **Any bleeding concerns or complications?**
- [ ] Required dose reduction or anticoagulant change?

#### Other Complications
- [ ] Warfarin skin necrosis (rare)
- [ ] HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) if on heparin
- [ ] Drug interactions (especially with warfarin)

---

### POST-THROMBOTIC SYNDROME (PTS)

#### Chronic Symptoms After DVT
- [ ] Leg swelling (chronic edema)
- [ ] Leg pain or heaviness (chronic)
- [ ] Skin changes (pigmentation, thickening)
- [ ] Venous ulcers (from chronic venous insufficiency post-DVT)
- [ ] Severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- [ ] Functional impact (limits walking or activity)

#### Management of PTS
- [ ] Compression stockings (grade, compliance)
- [ ] Leg elevation
- [ ] Venous ablation if superficial reflux contributing

---

### THROMBOPHILIA WORKUP (If Done)

#### Inherited Thrombophilias
- [ ] Factor V Leiden mutation
- [ ] Prothrombin G20210A mutation
- [ ] Antithrombin deficiency
- [ ] Protein C deficiency
- [ ] Protein S deficiency

#### Acquired Thrombophilias
- [ ] Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS):
  - Lupus anticoagulant
  - Anticardiolipin antibodies
  - Anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies
  - Requires indefinite anticoagulation
- [ ] Elevated factor VIII
- [ ] Hyperhomocysteinemia

#### Family History
- [ ] First-degree relatives with VTE (especially <50 years old)
- [ ] Multiple family members with clots
- [ ] Suggests inherited thrombophilia

---

### CURRENT SYMPTOMS (If Applicable)

#### Active DVT Symptoms
- [ ] Leg swelling (unilateral, usually)
- [ ] Leg pain or tenderness
- [ ] Warmth and redness
- [ ] Palpable cord (thrombosed vein)
- [ ] Positive Homan's sign (calf pain with dorsiflexion - not reliable)

#### Active PE Symptoms
- [ ] Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
- [ ] Chest pain (pleuritic - worse with breathing)
- [ ] Cough or hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
- [ ] Lightheadedness or syncope
- [ ] Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
- [ ] Hypoxia (low oxygen saturation)

### IMPLICATIONS FOR VASCULAR SURGERY

#### Perioperative Anticoagulation Management
- [ ] **Anticoagulation will need to be held for surgery**
- [ ] **Timing of holding anticoagulation**:
  - Warfarin: Stop 5 days before surgery, check INR
  - DOACs: Stop 1-3 days before (depends on kidney function)
  - Lovenox: Stop 12-24 hours before
- [ ] **Bridge therapy** (if high VTE risk):
  - Use Lovenox or heparin as bridge
  - Stop shorter-acting agent closer to surgery
  - Restart after surgery when bleeding risk acceptable
- [ ] **When to resume anticoagulation post-op**:
  - Typically 24-48 hours post-op
  - Balance VTE risk vs bleeding risk
  - Coordinate with surgeon and hematology

#### Risk Assessment for Surgery
- [ ] **Increased surgical risk**:
  - VTE patients at higher risk for recurrent clots perioperatively
  - Holding anticoagulation increases VTE risk
  - Higher risk of bleeding complications if on anticoagulation
- [ ] **Timing of surgery after acute VTE**:
  - Ideally delay elective surgery 3-6 months after acute VTE
  - If urgent surgery needed, discuss risks/benefits
- [ ] **Prophylactic measures**:
  - Sequential compression devices (SCDs) during surgery
  - Early mobilization post-op
  - Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis if appropriate

- [ ] Determine duration of anticoagulation
- [ ] Thrombophilia workup if needed
- [ ] Management of recurrent VTE

- [ ] Importance of medication adherence
- [ ] Bleeding precautions
- [ ] When to seek emergency care

#### Signs of Recurrent VTE
- [ ] Leg swelling, pain, warmth (DVT)
- [ ] Sudden shortness of breath, chest pain (PE)

---

### FOLLOW-UP PLAN
- Follow-up with vascular surgery (timing)
- Follow-up with hematology or primary care (anticoagulation management)
- Repeat imaging if needed (venous ultrasound)
- INR check (if on warfarin) - when and where
- Perioperative plan documented and communicated to patient

---

## VTE CATEGORIZATION
- [ ] **First provoked VTE**: 3-6 months anticoagulation, low recurrence risk
- [ ] **First unprovoked VTE**: Consider indefinite anticoagulation, higher recurrence risk
- [ ] **Recurrent VTE**: Indefinite anticoagulation, very high recurrence risk
- [ ] **Cancer-associated VTE**: Anticoagulate during active cancer treatment
- [ ] **Post-thrombotic syndrome**: Chronic venous insufficiency management

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Clearly distinguish provoked vs unprovoked VTE (affects treatment duration)
- Document exact timing of VTE events (critical for surgical planning)
- Note current anticoagulation type and dose exactly
- Extract any bleeding complications (important safety information)
- Capture perioperative anticoagulation plan if surgery discussed
- Note coordination with hematology or primary care
