# PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE (PAD) TEMPLATE

**Use for patients with leg claudication, rest pain, or tissue loss.**

---

## INCLUDE ALL UNIVERSAL SECTIONS
*(Demographics, Chief Complaint, Cardiovascular History, Metabolic/Systemic, Surgical History, Current Medications, Allergies)*

---

## PAD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT

### CLAUDICATION EVALUATION

#### Walking Distance & Location
- How far can patient walk before leg pain starts?
  - Blocks, feet, minutes of walking
- Where is the pain located?
  - Calf (most common)
  - Thigh
  - Buttock (aortoiliac disease)
  - Foot

#### Pain Characteristics
- Does pain stop when patient rests?
- How long does it take for pain to resolve with rest? (minutes)
- Does pain occur with other activities (stairs, inclines)?
- Any cramping, heaviness, or fatigue in legs?

#### Functional Impact
- Has walking distance decreased over time?
- Does it limit daily activities or quality of life?
- Can patient walk to mailbox, around house, grocery store?

---

### REST PAIN ASSESSMENT
- [ ] Does patient have pain in feet/toes at night when lying down?
- [ ] Does pain wake patient from sleep?
- [ ] Does patient need to hang leg off bed to relieve pain?
- [ ] Does patient sleep in a recliner or chair?
- [ ] Is pain relieved by dangling leg (dependency)?
- [ ] Location of rest pain (toes, forefoot, entire foot)

---

### TISSUE LOSS / WOUNDS
- [ ] Any open wounds, sores, or ulcers on legs/feet?
- [ ] Location (toes, heel, between toes, lateral foot)
- [ ] How long has wound been present?
- [ ] How did it start? (trauma, spontaneous, pressure)
- [ ] Size and depth of wound
- [ ] Drainage, odor, or signs of infection
- [ ] Previous toe amputations or debridements
- [ ] Any gangrene or black tissue?

---

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS

#### Pulse Examination (CRITICAL)
Document each pulse as: **Present / Absent / Dopplerable**

**Right Leg:**
- [ ] Right femoral pulse
- [ ] Right popliteal pulse
- [ ] Right dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse
- [ ] Right posterior tibial (PT) pulse

**Left Leg:**
- [ ] Left femoral pulse
- [ ] Left popliteal pulse
- [ ] Left dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse
- [ ] Left posterior tibial (PT) pulse

#### ABI Results (Ankle-Brachial Index)
- Right ABI: ____
- Left ABI: ____
- Interpretation:
  - Normal: >0.9
  - Mild PAD: 0.7-0.9
  - Moderate PAD: 0.4-0.7
  - Severe PAD: <0.4

#### Skin & Tissue Examination
- [ ] Hair loss on legs/feet (sign of chronic ischemia)
- [ ] Skin temperature (cool vs warm, compare sides)
- [ ] Skin color (pale, rubor/redness on dependency, cyanotic)
- [ ] Trophic changes (shiny skin, thick/brittle nails)
- [ ] Capillary refill time (normal <2 seconds)
- [ ] Muscle atrophy
- [ ] Edema (if present, note pitting vs non-pitting)

---

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES DISCUSSED
- [ ] Arterial duplex ultrasound (ordered/pending/results)
- [ ] CT angiography (CTA) of lower extremities
- [ ] Angiogram (invasive imaging)
- [ ] Toe pressures or TcPO2 (tissue oxygen)
- [ ] Previous vascular imaging results

---

### TREATMENT PLAN DISCUSSION

#### Medical Management
- [ ] Risk factor modification discussed:
  - Smoking cessation (if applicable)
  - Blood pressure control (target <140/80)
  - Diabetes control (target A1C <6.5-7.0)
  - Lipid control (statin therapy)
- [ ] Antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 81mg or Plavix 75mg
- [ ] Walking exercise program discussed
- [ ] Cilostazol (Pletal) if not on anticoagulation

#### Procedural/Surgical Options Discussed
- [ ] Angioplasty with stenting
- [ ] Bypass surgery (type: fem-pop, fem-fem, aorto-bifem)
- [ ] Atherectomy
- [ ] Amputation (if non-salvageable)
- [ ] Wound care and debridement

#### Follow-Up Plan
- When to return for follow-up
- Imaging scheduled
- Procedure scheduled (date/location)
- Warning signs to watch for (worsening pain, wound infection, cold foot)

---

## SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION
Based on conversation, classify as:
- [ ] **Mild PAD**: Claudication only, good walking distance
- [ ] **Moderate PAD**: Limiting claudication, reduced walking distance
- [ ] **Severe PAD**: Short-distance claudication, rest pain, or tissue loss
- [ ] **Critical Limb Ischemia**: Rest pain and/or tissue loss (urgent)

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Pay special attention to pulse exam findings (critical for surgical planning)
- Document exact walking distances when mentioned
- Note whether symptoms are unilateral or bilateral
- Flag any urgent red flags: acute limb ischemia (cold, pale, pulseless leg)
- Extract ABI numbers exactly as stated
