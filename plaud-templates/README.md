## 🎯 WHY USE THESE TEMPLATES?

**PLAUD AI** is a voice recorder with transcription and AI-powered summarization. When you use a custom template, PLAUD structures its summary output based on your template instructions — extracting specific data points, organizing information into sections, and generating a professional clinical note automatically.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Faster documentation** — Record interview → Get structured note
- ✅ **Consistent format** — Every note follows the same structure
- ✅ **Complete data capture** — Templates prompt for all critical information
- ✅ **Better accuracy** — Custom vocabulary improves medical term transcription
- ✅ **Reduces missed details** — Template ensures comprehensive assessment

## ⚙️ TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

### Recording Tips
- **Place PLAUD near the speaker** (on desk, clip to clothing)
- **Speak clearly** — enunciate medical terms
- **State key findings explicitly** (e.g., "Right dorsalis pedis pulse is absent")
- **Minimize background noise** if possible

### Template Optimization
- **Edit templates to match your workflow** — These are starting points, not rigid rules
- **Add your preferred phrasing** if you have standard questions you always ask
- **Remove sections you don't use** to make output more concise

### Custom Vocabulary
- **Add new terms as you encounter them** — Expand the vocabulary list over time
- **Include brand names** of medications you commonly prescribe
- **Add anatomical variants** or terms specific to your practice

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "PLAUD isn't extracting the information I need"
- **Solution:** Edit your template to be more explicit. Add specific bullet points for what you want captured. Example: Change "Document pulse exam" to "Document each pulse as Present/Absent/Dopplerable: Right femoral, Left femoral, Right DP, Left DP..."

### "Transcription has errors with medical terms"
- **Solution:** Add those terms to Custom Vocabulary. Spell them exactly as they should appear.

### "Summary is too long / too short"
- **Solution:** Adjust your template. Remove unnecessary sections to shorten. Add more detailed subsections to lengthen.

### "PLAUD summary format doesn't match template exactly"
- **Note:** PLAUD's AI interprets the template as guidance, not rigid instructions. It will extract relevant information but may not follow the exact format. This is normal. Review and edit the output.

## 📊 TEMPLATE STRUCTURE EXPLAINED

Each template follows this structure:

1. **Universal Sections** (demographics, chief complaint, medical history, medications, allergies)
2. **Condition-Specific Assessment** (symptoms, physical exam, diagnostic studies)
3. **Treatment Plan** (medical management, procedures, patient education)
4. **Follow-Up Plan** (next steps, appointments, warning signs)

**The AI extracts information from the conversation and organizes it into these sections automatically.**

## 🔄 UPDATING TEMPLATES

As your workflow evolves, update your templates:

1. Open the template file on your computer (in this folder)
2. Edit the content (add/remove sections, change wording)
3. Copy the updated template
4. In PLAUD app: Settings → Custom Templates → Select template → Edit → Paste new version → Save

## 📞 EXAMPLE WORKFLOW: PAD PATIENT

**Before:**
- Patient with leg pain when walking
- Select "PAD Template" in PLAUD app
- Press Record

**During:**
- "Tell me about your leg pain..."
- "How far can you walk before it bothers you?"
- (Conduct exam, document pulses)
- "We'll get an ABI and arterial ultrasound..."

**After:**
- Stop recording
- PLAUD transcribes and generates structured note with sections:
  - Chief Complaint: "Leg pain with walking for 6 months"
  - Claudication Assessment: "Walks 1-2 blocks, calf pain, resolves with rest in 2-3 minutes"
  - Pulse Exam: "Right DP absent, Left DP palpable..."
  - Plan: "ABI ordered, start aspirin 81mg daily, discuss smoking cessation..."
- Review, edit, export to EMR

**Result:** Comprehensive structured note in minutes instead of 15-20 minutes of manual typing.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### HIPAA & Privacy
- **PLAUD recordings contain PHI (Protected Health Information)**
- Follow your institution's policies on recording patient encounters
- Obtain patient consent if required
- Secure your PLAUD device and app with password/biometric lock
- Do not share recordings or transcripts inappropriately

### Clinical Responsibility
- **AI-generated summaries are tools, not replacements for clinical judgment**
- Always **review and edit** the summary before finalizing
- Verify **critical data** (measurements, medications, test results)
- PLAUD may miss or misinterpret information — your review is essential

### Limitations
- PLAUD works best in **quiet environments**
- Transcription accuracy decreases with **heavy accents** or **mumbling**
- AI summaries are **not perfect** — expect to make edits
- Templates are **guidance** — AI interprets them, doesn't follow them rigidly
