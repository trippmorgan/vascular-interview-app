## VENOUS DISEASE-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT

### SWELLING EVALUATION

#### Timing & Pattern
- [ ] Does patient have leg swelling?
- [ ] Unilateral (one leg) or bilateral (both legs)?
- [ ] Is swelling worse at end of day / afternoon?
- [ ] Is swelling better in the morning after sleep?
- [ ] Does elevation of legs reduce swelling?
- [ ] How long has swelling been present?

#### Characteristics
- [ ] Location (ankle, calf, entire leg, thigh)
- [ ] Pitting edema (leaves impression when pressed)?
- [ ] Severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- [ ] Any associated redness or warmth?

---

### PAIN & DISCOMFORT

#### Aching/Heaviness
- [ ] Do legs feel heavy or achy?
- [ ] When is discomfort worst? (End of day, after standing)
- [ ] Does elevation or rest relieve symptoms?
- [ ] Any throbbing or burning sensation?
- [ ] How does it affect daily activities or work?

#### Distinguish from Arthritis
- [ ] Morning stiffness? (suggests arthritis, not venous)
- [ ] Joint pain vs diffuse leg discomfort
- [ ] Pain with movement vs pain with standing

#### Nighttime Symptoms
- [ ] Any pain or discomfort at night?
- [ ] Restless legs or cramping?
- [ ] Does it interfere with sleep?

---

### VARICOSE VEINS ASSESSMENT
- [ ] Visible bulging or rope-like veins?
- [ ] Location (medial thigh, calf, behind knee)
- [ ] Are veins bothersome or just cosmetic concern?
- [ ] Any bleeding from varicose veins?
- [ ] Previous vein treatment (stripping, ablation, sclerotherapy)?
  - When and what type of treatment?
  - Did it help?

---

### SKIN CHANGES
- [ ] Skin discoloration (brown, red, purple staining)
- [ ] Location of skin changes (ankle, lower leg)
- [ ] Skin thickening or hardening (lipodermatosclerosis)
- [ ] Active venous ulcer (open sore)?
  - Location, size, duration
  - Drainage, pain level
- [ ] History of healed ulcers?
- [ ] Itching or skin irritation

---

### COMPRESSION THERAPY
- [ ] Is patient currently wearing compression socks/stockings?
- [ ] If yes:
  - What strength/grade? (15-20 mmHg, 20-30 mmHg, 30-40 mmHg)
  - How often worn? (all day, morning only, inconsistent)
  - Compliance: "Are you doing a good job wearing them?"
- [ ] If no: Has compression been tried or recommended before?
- [ ] Any difficulty putting them on or tolerating them?

---

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS

#### Arterial Status First (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Document that arterial circulation is adequate
- [ ] "Your arterial circulation is good, you have good pulses"
- [ ] This rules out arterial disease before treating venous

#### Venous Examination
- [ ] Visible varicose veins (location, extent)
- [ ] Edema assessment:
  - Grade (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+)
  - Pitting vs non-pitting
  - Location
- [ ] Skin examination:
  - Hemosiderin staining (brown discoloration)
  - Lipodermatosclerosis (thickened skin)
  - Eczema or dermatitis
  - Active or healed ulcers

#### CEAP Classification (if mentioned)
- C0: No visible venous disease
- C1: Telangiectasia or reticular veins
- C2: Varicose veins
- C3: Edema
- C4: Skin changes (pigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis)
- C5: Healed venous ulcer
- C6: Active venous ulcer

---

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

#### Venous Duplex Ultrasound Results
- [ ] Great saphenous vein (GSV) status:
  - Reflux present? (pathologic if >2 seconds)
  - Vein diameter (mm)
  - Reflux time (seconds)
- [ ] Small saphenous vein (SSV) involvement?
- [ ] Perforator vein incompetence?
- [ ] Deep venous system (patent vs occluded, competent vs reflux)
- [ ] Diameter/flow metric (normal <500, abnormal >500)

#### Other Studies
- [ ] Previous DVT workup
- [ ] Arterial studies (to rule out PAD)

---

### PATIENT EDUCATION DELIVERED

#### Explanation of Venous Reflux
- [ ] "One of the veins is flowing the wrong way"
- [ ] "Think of it like pipes flowing backwards"
- [ ] "The vein valves aren't working properly"
- [ ] Diagram shown or drawing made?

#### Treatment Goals Explained
- [ ] Prevent sores/wounds from developing
- [ ] Reduce swelling
- [ ] Improve heavy/achy feeling
- [ ] Cosmetic improvement (if applicable)

---

### TREATMENT PLAN DISCUSSION

#### Conservative Management
- [ ] Continue or start compression stockings
- [ ] Leg elevation throughout day
- [ ] Weight loss (if applicable)
- [ ] Exercise and walking program

#### Venous Ablation Procedure Explained
- [ ] "We give you medicine to make you sleepy"
- [ ] "Put an IV in the vein"
- [ ] "Insert a small probe/catheter"
- [ ] "The probe heats and seals the vein from inside"
- [ ] "Blood automatically reroutes to healthy veins"
- [ ] Procedure type: Radiofrequency vs laser vs chemical ablation
- [ ] Outpatient procedure
- [ ] Return to normal activity quickly

#### Post-Procedure Expectations
- [ ] Need to continue wearing compression socks after procedure
- [ ] Activity restrictions (if any)
- [ ] Follow-up ultrasound timing
- [ ] Expected improvement timeline (weeks to months)

#### Alternative/Additional Treatments
- [ ] Phlebectomy (removal of bulging veins)
- [ ] Sclerotherapy (injection treatment)
- [ ] Open surgery (vein stripping) - rarely done now

---

### FOLLOW-UP PLAN
- Follow-up appointment (when)
- Imaging scheduled
- Procedure scheduled (date, location)
- Instructions on when to call (increased pain, redness, warmth suggesting DVT)

---

## LATERALITY & SEVERITY
- [ ] **Right leg only**
- [ ] **Left leg only**
- [ ] **Both legs (bilateral)**

Severity:
- [ ] Mild (cosmetic concern, minimal symptoms)
- [ ] Moderate (bothersome swelling/aching, skin changes)
- [ ] Severe (ulceration, significant functional impairment)

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Distinguish venous symptoms from arterial disease (critical safety issue)
- Document compliance with compression therapy accurately
- Note whether symptoms are unilateral or bilateral (affects treatment)
- Extract exact measurements from ultrasound (reflux time, vein diameter)
- Capture patient education points discussed
