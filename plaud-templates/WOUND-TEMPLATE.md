- [ ] How long has patient had diabetes? (years)
- [ ] Hemoglobin A1C:
  - Most recent value
  - When was it checked?
  - Goal: <6.5-7.0% for wound healing
- [ ] "What do your blood sugars run?" (average daily glucose)
- [ ] Frequent high blood sugars or well-controlled?

#### Diabetes Management

- [ ] Cellulitis episodes
- [ ] Hospitalizations for foot infections
- [ ] IV antibiotics required in past

---

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

#### Vascular Studies (ESSENTIAL)
- [ ] ABI measurements (done today or scheduled)
- [ ] Arterial duplex ultrasound (ordered/pending/results)
- [ ] CTA of lower extremities (for severe PAD)
- [ ] Toe pressures or TcPO2 (tissue oxygen measurement)

#### Imaging for Infection
- [ ] X-ray of foot (ordered/results):
  - Rule out osteomyelitis (bone infection)
  - Gas in soft tissue
  - Bone destruction
- [ ] MRI of foot (if deep infection suspected):
  - Better visualization of soft tissue and bone infection
  - Abscess detection

#### Lab Work
- [ ] CBC (white blood cell count - infection marker)
- [ ] CRP or ESR (inflammation markers)
- [ ] Blood glucose / Hemoglobin A1C
- [ ] Wound culture (if infected)
- [ ] Blood cultures (if systemically ill)
- [ ] Kidney function (creatinine) - affects contrast studies and medication dosing

#### Neurologic Studies
- [ ] EMG / Nerve conduction studies (document neuropathy)
- [ ] Monofilament testing
- [ ] Vibration sense testing (128 Hz tuning fork)

---

### CURRENT WOUND CARE REGIMEN
- [ ] What is patient currently doing for wound?
- [ ] Dressing type (gauze, foam, hydrocolloid, alginate)
- [ ] Dressing change frequency
- [ ] Topical agents (antibiotic ointment, silver, honey)
- [ ] Who changes dressing? (patient, family, home health, wound care clinic)
- [ ] Compliance with wound care

---

### TREATMENT PLAN DISCUSSION

#### Immediate Wound Care
- [ ] Debridement (removal of dead tissue):
  - In office vs OR
  - Extent (sharp debridement vs surgical)
- [ ] Dressing type and frequency
- [ ] Referral to wound care clinic
- [ ] Home health for dressing changes

#### Offloading (CRITICAL for Diabetic Foot Ulcers)
- [ ] Special boot/shoe (walking boot, diabetic shoe)
- [ ] Crutches or walker
- [ ] Wheelchair (non-weight-bearing)
- [ ] "Stay off your feet as much as possible"
- [ ] Total contact cast (if appropriate)

#### Infection Management
- [ ] Oral antibiotics:
  - Medication name and dose
  - Duration
  - Coverage (gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobes)
- [ ] IV antibiotics:
  - Inpatient vs outpatient IV therapy
  - PICC line placement
  - Duration (typically 4-6 weeks for osteomyelitis)
- [ ] Hospitalization needed?

#### Vascular Intervention
- [ ] If inadequate blood flow:
  - Angioplasty/stenting
  - Bypass surgery
  - "We need to improve blood flow before wound can heal"
- [ ] Timeline for intervention

#### Surgical Options
- [ ] Incision and drainage (if abscess)
- [ ] Surgical debridement
- [ ] Toe amputation (if non-salvageable):
  - Which toe(s)
  - "Removing the infected/dead toe to save the rest of the foot"
- [ ] Transmetatarsal amputation
- [ ] Below-knee amputation (if foot not salvageable)

#### Diabetes Optimization
- [ ] Coordinate with endocrinology or primary care
- [ ] Adjust diabetes medications
- [ ] Target A1C <6.5-7.0% for optimal healing
- [ ] Dietary counseling

#### Prevention Education
- [ ] Daily foot inspections
- [ ] Proper footwear (diabetic shoes, custom orthotics)
- [ ] Never walk barefoot
- [ ] Nail care (see podiatrist)
- [ ] Moisturize feet (but not between toes)
- [ ] Control blood sugars

---

### PROGNOSIS & GOALS

#### Healing Potential
- [ ] Good healing potential (adequate blood flow, well-controlled diabetes)
- [ ] Guarded prognosis (poor blood flow, uncontrolled diabetes, infection)
- [ ] Non-salvageable (extensive tissue loss, overwhelming infection)

#### Realistic Goals Discussed
- [ ] Complete wound healing
- [ ] Limb salvage (save the leg/foot)
- [ ] Functional amputation (if cannot save)
- [ ] Prevent spread of infection
- [ ] Improve quality of life

---

### FOLLOW-UP PLAN
- Wound check appointment (frequency: weekly, biweekly)
- Vascular imaging scheduled
- Procedure/surgery scheduled (date, location)
- Home health or wound clinic referral
- Podiatry follow-up
- Endocrinology/diabetes management follow-up
- **Red flags to call immediately**:
  - Fever or chills
  - Spreading redness
  - Increased pain, swelling, drainage
  - Foul odor
  - Dark or black tissue developing

---

## WOUND SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION
- [ ] **Superficial**: Skin-level ulcer, no infection, adequate blood flow
- [ ] **Moderate**: Deeper wound, mild infection, or borderline perfusion
- [ ] **Severe**: Deep wound with exposed bone/tendon, active infection, poor perfusion
- [ ] **Critical**: Limb-threatening infection or ischemia, requires urgent intervention

---

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
- Document wound characteristics in detail (size, depth, appearance)
- Note vascular status (pulses, ABI) - critical for determining treatment
- Capture diabetes control metrics (A1C, glucose levels)
- Document neuropathy assessment ("Can you feel your feet?")
- Extract treatment plan including offloading strategy
- Flag urgent situations (sepsis, gangrene, rapidly spreading infection)
- Note patient understanding of wound care and prevention
